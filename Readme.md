This repository contains data and analysis scripts from the paper "Sources of genetic variation in 
Faidherbia albida (Del.) A. Chev. Sub-Saharan African populations" 

Running analysis.R will reproduce the popualtion genetic analysis (PCA, ADMXITURE) shown in Figures 2 
and 4 of the paper. As well as the R maps package, You will need the software ADMIXTURE and plink 
installed - we used ADMIXTURE 
v1.3.0 and plink v1.90b7 but other versions will probably work.
